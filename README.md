# MusicDB
In this project, I queried the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. For this project, I assisted the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information.

4 questions answered using SQL, then visualized and presented using Power BI and Powerpoint.
